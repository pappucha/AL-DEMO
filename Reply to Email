Hi Annika , 

Thanks for the task. And being honest  i really enjoyed writing this task. Because I haven't written any applications from scratch since past 7 months. Have been quite buzy with normal coding in the past few months . So it was more of energetic , fun work and quite interesting. I have mainly focused on implementation of the task. I could have decorated more by making class files more neat and documenting the code by region. But again this is just the baby step of my interview process and would give more clarification about my work .When we talk again. 

I have zipped the complete source code along with email. As mentioned in your previous email to use bitbucket code repository for assignment. Unfortunately i have only one laptop which is my office laptop. And I am not allowed to connect any repositories such as Github and bitbucket or any other Tfs Server. But they do allow to take files from your machine after approval.But again if required we can have a call and i can screen share my machine . Where i will explain the whole implementation step by step . And also open to answer any queries  in the code. Also it was not listed in the Question sample . But i can write the angular part as well with implemented architecture which will connect to this code service.

Along with this mail . I am attaching the following listed items. 

1) Code Document . Where i have to cover the scenario of explaining the layers. 
2) Source code in Zip File. 
3) I have created a sample database over the web. So you can easily unzip the file and run . It will automatically point to SQL server which is on Web . 
Credentials are attached in the document. 




Thanks And Regards
